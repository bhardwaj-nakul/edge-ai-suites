# Live Video Search Architecture

This document describes the end‑to‑end architecture of Live Video Search and how Smart NVR and VSS Search integrate.

```

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Cameras stream into Frigate, which records clips and publishes events via MQTT.
2. **Event Routing**: NVR Event Router receives events and associates clips with camera metadata.
3. **Indexing**: Smart NVR sends selected clips to Pipeline Manager, which forwards them to DataPrep. Embeddings are stored in VDMS.
4. **Querying**: Users query VSS UI with optional time‑range filters. Search‑MS retrieves and ranks relevant clips.
5. **Visualization**: Results are shown in VSS UI while Smart NVR UI remains available for live context.
6. **Telemetry**: Collector streams system metrics to Pipeline Manager and the UI.

## Integration Points

- **Smart NVR upload path** ties selected clips directly to VSS Search input.
- **Pipeline Manager endpoints** unify search configuration and retrieval.
- **Telemetry WS** provides live metrics for operational visibility.
